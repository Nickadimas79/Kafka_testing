# kafka_testing

Testing service for creation of a Consumer/Producer that has gRPC communication abilities as well. The inital intent here to model a Producer/Consumer architecture that can work with Kafka emiting events for the service to act on based on the incoming gRPC actions. This is not meant to all be one service necessarily but is being modeled this way right now for ease.
